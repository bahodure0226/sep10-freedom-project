                <p id="para">I chose the topic of sports because I have been playing a variety of sports throughout my whole life and it is my passion. Since I was young, I would always want to be outside and do things that required me moving around a lot. I naturally learned a lot about different sports as i was involved and passionate in many sports teams. This made me pick sports because I knew I would be able to come up with some ideas for the future of sports that involved technology because I discovered many flaws in current sports technology.

            <h2 class="bub fade">Existing Technology</h2>
              <p id="right">The inventions currently present in the field of sports have 3 categories, Athlete utilities, Fan utilities, and official utilities.
              Athlete utilities include physical, wearable undershirts that can track vitals, gps, and movement. Virtually we have some simple simulations and athlete statistics to allow athletes to envision what they can do on the field and what they have already done.
              Fan/outsider utilities include physical cameras all around that show the game real time and virtual sports apps that show details about players, matches, and even bets placed.
              Official utilities used to keep the game fair are VARs(Video Assistant Referee), which basically take recordings of the game and can be used to replay parts of the match when there are arguments about referee calls.

            <p class="fpart">For future technology in sports, I have come up with many ideas on what we could use and benefit from. One idea I have for the future is 3d holographic technology that is interactive. There can be holograms that simulate the feeling of playing with top level players even when you are alone, for example in soccer you could try to shoot a goal while there is a holographic goalkeeper with the skills of a national level player. Calls could be made by holographic referees in official matches that have data from cameras all around so they can make the proper calls every time without bias. Another Idea is a room that has these holograms but can control how fast time moves, like if you were to replay a part of the game and want to analyze it closely, you can replicate all of the players moving and make decisions based on the analysis. These technologies could help the sports field greatly because they would create more top level players, and it would attract more people to sports, making humans generally more athletic with these devices.</p>

# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **Animate CSS**

---

### 3/8:
* I went to [Animate.css](https://animate.style/)
  * I looked through every aspect of Animate CSS and explored each of the examples
  * I picked some that I liked
* I went to edit on github and tried some out on my own
  * I took this code example below and started tinkering with it because I liked the rubber band animation
 ```CSS
   @keyframes rubberBand {
  from {
    -webkit-transform: scale3d(1, 1, 1);
    transform: scale3d(1, 1, 1);
  }
  30% {
    -webkit-transform: scale3d(1.25, 0.75, 1);
    transform: scale3d(1.25, 0.75, 1);
  }
  40% {
    -webkit-transform: scale3d(0.75, 1.25, 1);
    transform: scale3d(0.75, 1.25, 1);
  }
  50% {
    -webkit-transform: scale3d(1.15, 0.85, 1);
    transform: scale3d(1.15, 0.85, 1);
  }
  65% {
    -webkit-transform: scale3d(0.95, 1.05, 1);
    transform: scale3d(0.95, 1.05, 1);
  }
  75% {
    -webkit-transform: scale3d(1.05, 0.95, 1);
    transform: scale3d(1.05, 0.95, 1);
  }
  to {
    -webkit-transform: scale3d(1, 1, 1);
    transform: scale3d(1, 1, 1);
  }
}
.animate__rubberBand {
  -webkit-animation-name: rubberBand;
  animation-name: rubberBand;
```
* I went to [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp) CSS Animations
  * I tested out the code and created my own little ideas with them
* I went to [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#applied-visual-design)
  * I completed the lessons on CSS Animations
* I made a lot of progress getting familiar with CSS Animation elements
* It is very tedious code so I had some challenges with keeping everything organized
* Are there any shortcuts to using CSS Animation that would make it easier and faster to use?

### 3/16:
* I didn't have much time to learn this week due to some personal things as well as sports, but I skimmed through [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgmNxE9lWcY) about basic CSS animations.
  *  I learned about how to make buttons move when hovered over.
* I also watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2LQYsZhsFw) about CSS animation properties.
  *  I learned about transformations and changing shapes by changing the border radius.
  * I tinkered a bit with CSS Animations once again so I wouldn't forget too much, but it was all minor tinkering and refreshing my memory, I did not do try too many new aspects of CSS animate this week.

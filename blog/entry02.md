I searched for "devices in sports" and "sports technology apps" which led me to articles such as [TOP 7 Sports Technology Trends and Innovations to Adopt in Sports Apps in 2024](https://mobidev.biz/blog/sports-technology-trends-innovations-to-adopt-in-sports-apps) , [Wearable Technology in Sports](https://www.catapult.com/blog/wearable-technology-in-sports) and [Innovating the Sports Industry: How Software Development Services Can Help](https://container-news.com/innovating-the-sports-industry-how-software-development-services-can-help/).

# Entry 2: Beginning My Research

## What I have found
After choosing my topic and starting my reasearch, I began to look for hardware and software that are currently being used in sports. I searched for "devices in sports" and "sports technology apps" which led me to websites such as [TOP 7 Sports Technology Trends and Innovations to Adopt in Sports Apps in 2024](https://mobidev.biz/blog/sports-technology-trends-innovations-to-adopt-in-sports-apps) , [Wearable Technology in Sports](https://www.catapult.com/blog/wearable-technology-in-sports) and [Innovating the Sports Industry: How Software Development Services Can Help](https://container-news.com/innovating-the-sports-industry-how-software-development-services-can-help/). I looked through these websites and found many software and hardware innovations within sports. Some of these include things like wearable technology and equipment as well as analysis and simulation. The wearable technology can be used to analyze the health and state of an athlete during the game as well as give information to software that can later simulate ways to help the athlete and prevent injury. I also discovered that software can allow for event management, fan engagement, and keep track of player stats which can be accessed by fans through certain apps. I revised my search to make it more direct by searching "Software and Hardware used in Sports" to get information from more websites but after going through some of them, I got the same information that I had from my original search and decided that I didn't need to revise my search.

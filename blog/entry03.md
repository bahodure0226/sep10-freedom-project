## The Future
In entry 2 I researched about technology within sports and discovered many ways that we currently use technology in the sports field. In this entry, I have been brainstorming about possible technological advancements we could have in the future of sports. I first looked at what we already had and then I thought about what **_I_** would want for the future of sports. I came up with one detailed idea, a few less detailed ideas, and a few ideas with simple details. My detailed idea was about 3D holographic practices where you can interact with the holograms. For soccer there could be holographic [players](https://as2.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/02/72/31/49/1000_F_272314919_tuSZVX3wXLjzDhtNjPCy9wXuTpkFVpPF.jpg) and goalkeepers that you shoot a ball against, but the ball has a sensor that detects these holograms and bounces off of them as if they were real people. For volleyball and basketball it could be a similar thing, players can practice against “top level” holograms that play like real life top level players. Holograms could replicate the skill level of any sport player, they would help players because the players would be able to study the movements of the holograms and learn from them. During games even referees could be replaced by AI holograms that would make the proper calls each time.

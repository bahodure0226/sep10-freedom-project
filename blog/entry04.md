## My tool
During the time between the last entry and this one, I was given many different coding tools to use. I originally chose Aframe because it seemed really cool to have 3d shapes that I could control to make models. After tinkering with that for a while I decided that it was too difficult for me so I chose my backup, Animate CSS. I tinkered with this tool on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp). At first I just read through the articles and clicked "try it yourself", this gave me an idea of how to use the tool. I then changed the code myself and created this little box that changes between colors as the animation begins and ends.
```HTML
<style> 
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 2s;
}

@keyframes example {
  0% {background-color: red;}
  25% {background-color: purple;}
  50% {background-color: yellow;}
  75% {background-color: blue;}
  100% {background-color: green;}
}
</style>
```

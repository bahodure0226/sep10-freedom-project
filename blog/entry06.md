### MVP
* Before starting my MVP, I made a plan page which really helped me stay on track throughout my project. Although I did not follow the plan the whole time I was able to complete my MVP because I changed my workload for different days when I couldn't do the part that I had [planned](../prep/plan.md) on a certain day. While working on my MVP, I included the code from my previous test projects in my terminal, this made coding a lot easier since I had most of it planned out. The content of my MVP was mostly written without a plan besides for the inventions which I had already brainstormed a while ago. In my project I had CSS, HTML, bootstrap components, grid, and also my tool animate CSS. One challenge I had was trying to make my page responsive to different screen sizes, this would often happen:
```CSS
@media (min-width:768px){
.boot {
  margin-left:400px;
}
.sub {
  margin-left:200px;
}
.bub {
  margin-left:220px;
}
}
.future {
  font-size:40px;
}
```
* This really stumped me at first because everything looked correct, but when switching screen sizes the `.future` class did not apply which made me frustrated but then I saw that the `media query` closed before the `.future` class meaning that it would not apply. I went through [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-principles/create-a-media-query) and checked out the media query lessons again to see if I had done anything wrong.
I fixed this problem across multiple media queries and it completely fixed my problems since all of them were due to this exact problem.
* Another challenge I had was pretty simple, my images wouldn't stay centered when I tried to make them take a certain width of the page, it was always looking really ugly and messy. I had no fix to this so I decided to just let it take the whole width of the page because then it would stay centered no matter what size the screen was.

* The takeaways I had from these two challenges were that one, I should count the amount of opening and closing tags when using CSS, especially on media queries, and two, if I can't find a solution to something, find an alternative(like making the width take the full screen so I don't have to try and center it for each different size). This MVP helped me learn a good amount.
### Engineering Design Process
* I am currently on the last few stages of the EDP, I created my prototype and tested it, finally, I had it evaluated by peers and made improvements to it afterwards. I am done with the EDP for my Freedom Project, but I may have more to improve after we proceed with our in class presentations and SEP wide presentations.

### Skills
Some skills I have improved on or learned are **_improvising_**, **_planning_**, and **_collaborating_**. I improved on my planning by giving myself leeway for the timeline, I made a simple and easy to follow plan so even if I was busy on one of my planned days, I could make up for it by shifting the workload since I spread it out pretty evenly. I was able to improvise greatly by changing how I formatted the image when I could not figure out how to center it with the previous format I used. The collaboration skill was useful when we went around and shared our projects while making comments to other people, it helped me improve the color scheme of my website from a bland white background to a more colorful website.

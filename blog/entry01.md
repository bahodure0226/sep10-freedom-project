I chose the topic of sports, I chose this topic because I am very passionate about sports and like to watch them as well. I play many sports and want to improve them in many ways, researching about technology in sports can help me understand what needs to be changed for improvement and what role technology can play in sports. I was also contemplating between fitness and animation but decided on sports because I have the most involvement and interest in this field. Some articles about these topics are [Sports Technology Thatâ€™s Revolutionizing Sports in 2024](https://cactusware.com/blog/sports-technology) by Diamond Scheduler, [The impact of technology on sports](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162522003626) by Science Direct, [How Technology Has Transformed Animation](https://www.prayananimation.com/blog/how-technology-has-transformed-animation-a-look-at-the-past-present-and-future/) by Prayan Animation, and [The Future of Fitness Testing](https://www.topendsports.com/testing/future.htm) by Topend Sports.

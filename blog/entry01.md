## Choosing My Topic

I chose the topic of sports, I chose this topic because I am very passionate about sports and like to watch them as well. I play many sports and want to improve them in many ways, researching about technology in sports can help me understand what needs to be changed for improvement and what role technology can play in sports. I was also contemplating between fitness and animation but decided on sports because I have the most involvement and interest in this field. Some articles I discovered about these topics are [Sports Technology Thatâ€™s Revolutionizing Sports in 2024](https://cactusware.com/blog/sports-technology) by Diamond Scheduler, [The impact of technology on sports](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162522003626) by Science Direct, [How Technology Has Transformed Animation](https://www.prayananimation.com/blog/how-technology-has-transformed-animation-a-look-at-the-past-present-and-future/) by Prayan Animation, and [The Future of Fitness Testing](https://www.topendsports.com/testing/future.htm) by Topend Sports. Reading these articles gave me insight on how technology was currently being used in these fields and they really fascinated me, making me even more interested in sports than before.

## Engineering Design Process

I am currently in the first stage of the engineering design process, defining, and entering the second stage, researching. I defined what I want my project to be about and how I want to do my project. In the second stage, I am researching about how technology has improved the world of sports currently and I am brainstorming ideas for how it may be able to improve sports in the future. I will research more about what is missing within the world of sports and think about how technology could possibly solve those problems.

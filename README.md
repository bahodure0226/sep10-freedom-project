# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Bahodur Ergashev**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Sports**. 

Sports have been around since ancient times as a form of entertainment.
Many sports are usually played physically such as volleyball and basketball. But where does technology come into play?
This site will look at the uses of technology within sports, both in the past and with hopes and predictions for the future.

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study CSS Animations in order to help me make my website.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Culture: it will make the field of sports much more popular, leading to the global population becoming much more athletic, healthy, and living longer.
* Individual: This will give individuals with a passion for sports a way to express themselves, even if nobody else wants to put in the work, they can use this invention to practice as much as they want on any level.
* Big syems(sports field): This would increase the level of competition and play in sports, giving people more entertainment and bringing popularity to all sports, making them widespread and more needed.
##### CONS
* Finance(personal/corporate): This would give the people who manage sports, host sports, and creators of sports apps an incredible boost in profit with the popularity of sports rising greatly. Possibly leading to an inbalance of economy in favor of sports.
* Relationships: This may cause people to overwork themselves, spending too much time with holograms, causing them to be detached to others and possible become socially inept.
